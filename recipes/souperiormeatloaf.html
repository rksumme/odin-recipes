    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is Grandma's recipe for making meatloaf with a few minor tweaks. During cooking, drain the excess grease halfway through and again at the end. A turkey baster works great to get the grease out. It makes it less messy when served and easier to handle without sloshing when removing from the oven. Great served with mashed potatoes and peas.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 envelopes Lipton Onion Soup mix (onion, onion mushroom, or beefy onion)</li>
        <li>2 lbs ground beef</li>
        <li>1-1 1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Combine and thoroughly mix all ingredients in a large bowl</li>
        <li>Shape into a loaf in a 13x9-inch baking pan</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered until done, ~ 1 hour</li>
        <li>Remove and let stand 10 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
